InstantQueue for Youtube
=============

Quick playlist extension for Youtube

### What is it?

It is the quickest way to watch a bunch of videos on Youtube without the hassle of playlists or having to open them in tabs.

### What makes this good?

- ***Quick***: Just drag-and-drop videos from anywhere on Youtube and you have your instant playlist!
- ***Smart***: It plays your list for you, starting from the first and moving on to the next video automatically
- ***No hassle***: Playlists are temporary. Once you close your tab, they are gone. No maintanence necessary.
- ***Saveable***: Don't want to lose this list? That's fine too. Just export them to a real Youtube playlist.

### Installation

// Chrome store link goes here...

### Getting started

If you want, watch this short demo video that introduces you to everything you need to know (which is not much!)

Basically:
- You can add videos to your list by dragging-and-dropping them on to IQ the drawer on right-side of the screen.
- You can re-order your videos by dragging them in the list.
- You can remove videos by clicking the X on the lower right corner.
- You can let InstantQueue play your list by using "Play all" button. You can stop the auto-play any time using the same button.
- You can skip to the next video by clicking next (you can also click videos directly but that will not change auto-play order)
- You can export this list of videos to an actual Youtube playlist by using the export button (you must be logged in!)
- Once done, just close your tab and your list will be gone. _You can even create different playlists on different tabs at the same time!_

### Anything else?

Not really. You might have issues here and there but it works all the time, most of the time.

So pick a bunch of videos, sit back, relax and enjoy your new Youtube experience!
